Learning OpenCV 3
==========
This the impatently transcribed version of the book examples, and practice problem solving examples, as transcribed by FossBoss.
The mainline is not out yet, but youre reading the book, "Learning OpenCV3" and transcribing would be a pain. 

This repo should be obsoleted, once the main-line code is actualy posted, but prehaps improvements will present themselves here.




This is the example code that accompanies Learning OpenCV 3 by Adrian Kaehler and Gary Bradski (9781491937990).

This is the transcribed Code, from the book:
Learning OpenCV 3 by Adrian Kaehler and Gary Bradski
While the mainline repo continues to be inactive, and lacking in providing any of the code shown in the book, this repo attempts to provide that missing code. If you would like to join this project, let me know. I will also entertain submissions for the end of chapter review code, provided the question is clearly stated in the project, along with the corresponding page number.
